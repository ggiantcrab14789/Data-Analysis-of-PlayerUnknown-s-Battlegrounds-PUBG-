# Data Analysis of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG)#
PUBG is a complex and competitive game, with global tournaments for cash prizes driving a lot of players to take part. Notably, in June 2018, it was estimated that 400 million players around the globe play the battle royale-style game.

Because each game starts with 100 players, and the last person surviving is deemed the winner, the chance of winning is slim. Definitely, those chances increase as one plays the game and becomes more proficient and experienced. Better accuracy, better reaction times and more can contribute to a winning combination for players.

As such, the problem many players face is that their chance of winning is very low, especially if they’re a new player. It’s understandable that every day thousands of searches online for winning tactics and tips for the game are conducted. So we set out to gather data that correlates with winning players to understand what certain actions in the game could lead to more kills and a longer lifespan in the game, which could result in the player winning the game.

The first dataset I used is from Kaggle: PUBG Finish Placement Prediction

Second dataset is also from Kaggle: PUBG Match Deaths and Statistics
